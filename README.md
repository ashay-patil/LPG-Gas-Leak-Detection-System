# Description 
Gas leaks, particularly from Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders, pose a 
significant risk of accidents and fatalities in residential kitchens globally.<br> This project 
aims to develop a real-time LPG gas leak detection and alert system to mitigate these 
hazards. <br>The system is designed to detect gas leaks using an MQ-5 gas sensor and 
immediately trigger a high-decibel alarm to alert the occupants.<br> Additionally, it 
activates a 5V mini exhaust fan to expel the leaked gas from the kitchen, thereby 
reducing the risk of an explosion.<br> The system is controlled by an Arduino Uno Board, 
with real-time monitoring displayed on an LCD screen via an I2C module.<br> By 
implementing this system, households can significantly enhance their safety and 
prevent potentially catastrophic incidents.
